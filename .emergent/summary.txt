<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to create a pixel-perfect clone of the website .

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
-   **Business Name:** DryFruto
-   **Slogan:** Live With Health
-   **Logo:** An image provided by the user.
-   **Header:** Same as the original but with a darker shade.
-   **Content:** Specific lists of categories and product types to be displayed.
-   **Product Page:** Should have size variants, price, and details. Instead of a checkout, it must feature Whatsapp and Call buttons linked to the number .
-   **Admin Panel:** A full-featured admin panel requested later to manage all website content, including:
    -   A Front End section to manage images and descriptions for UI components.
    -   A Products section to manage product details (images, descriptions, prices).
-   **Deployment:** The user requested deployment guides for Hostinger, covering both manual and Docker-based methods.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete full-stack application that clones the requested website. The frontend is built with React and TailwindCSS, and the backend is a FastAPI application connected to a MongoDB database. The frontend is fully integrated with the backend, fetching all dynamic content (products, categories, etc.) via API calls. An admin panel is available at  for content management. All initial requirements, including the admin panel and deployment guides, have been implemented.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** The user requested to add the  file to the Docker deployment package. The agent created the necessary Docker files and a  but did not include  in the final deployment zip archive.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N/A
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual verification by checking the contents of the created zip file.
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   **Issue 1 (P0):** The  file is missing from the Docker deployment package.

    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. This was the last user request and has not been addressed.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        1.  Verify the existence of .
        2.  Modify the PK-À^š[ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ-PKPK-À^š[¶!-PK/M command used to create  to explicitly include .
        3.  Re-generate the zip archive and confirm the file's presence.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Including  is critical for creating deterministic and reproducible builds inside the Docker container. It ensures that the exact same dependencies are installed, preventing potential bugs or build failures in the deployment environment.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** No application testing needed.
    -   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
-   None.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   None. The user's requested features are complete. The next steps will depend on user feedback after reviewing the deployment package.

    -   Generated a Docker deployment guide ().
    -   Packaged application files into a zip archive for deployment.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   None. All identified issues, such as broken image links during initial development, were resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   None.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** React, React Router, TailwindCSS, shadcn/ui.
-   **Backend:** FastAPI, Pydantic.
-   **Database:** MongoDB (accessed via the  async driver).
-   **Architecture:** Decoupled full-stack application with a React SPA consuming a FastAPI REST API.
-   **State Management:** React Context API () is used to fetch and provide data globally to the frontend components.
-   **Deployment:** Dockerized solution using Docker Compose to orchestrate frontend, backend, and database services, with Nginx as a reverse proxy.

**key DB schema**
Schemas are implicitly defined in  using Pydantic models.
-   **Product:** , , , , , , , etc.
-   **Category:** , , .
-   **Testimonial:** , , .
-   **GiftBox:** , , , .
-   **HeroSlide:** , , , .

**changes in tech stack**
-   None. The standard React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack was used.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/backend/server.py**: Contains all backend API logic and database models.
-   **/app/frontend/src/App.js**: Defines all frontend routes, including the admin panel.
-   **/app/frontend/src/context/DataContext.jsx**: Manages all data fetching from the backend API.
-   **/app/frontend/src/pages/admin/**: Directory containing all components for the admin panel.
-   **/app/docker-compose.yml**: Key file defining the services for Docker-based deployment.
-   **/app/DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md**: Instructions for Docker deployment.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The phone number  is hardcoded in . This should be made configurable via the admin panel to avoid future code edits for simple data changes.

**key api endpoints**
-   : (GET) Fetches all data needed for the public-facing website in a single call.
-   : (POST) Populates the database with initial data.
-   : (GET, POST)
-   : (PUT, DELETE)
-   : (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
-   : (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
-   : (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
-   : (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The entire application is functional and complete based on the user's requests. The frontend is no longer using mock data; all content is dynamically loaded from the backend and manageable via the admin panel at .
-   Your immediate task is to address the user's final request: add  to the deployment package to ensure stable builds.
